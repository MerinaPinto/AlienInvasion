What went well: One aspect that went especially well during the development of this game was uploading, organizing, and managing the sprite list for the apples. Setting up the sprites correctly made it much easier to control how the apples appeared, moved, and interacted with the player’s horse. Because the sprite list was structured efficiently, the collision detection worked smoothly and consistently, which helped the overall gameplay feel responsive and polished. This part of the process also improved my understanding of sprite functions within the Arcade and showed me how careful organization can make later coding steps much easier. 


What was the biggest challenge: The biggest challenge I faced was controlling the rate at which the apples fell from the top of the screen. Finding the right balance between a speed that felt fair to the player and one that still created a sense of challenge required repeated testing and adjustment. At times, the apples fell too quickly and made the game frustrating, while at other times they fell too slowly and reduced excitement. Feedback from user testing was especially helpful in solving this problem. Testers suggested adding a continuous loop so apples would keep spawning from the top and appear visually connected to a tree sprite Kierra also sugessted the concept of the apples falling from the trees. This change made the gameplay feel more natural, improved the visual clarity of where the apples were coming from, and strengthened both the design and underlying logic of the program. 


What I would do further: If I had more time to continue developing the game, I would focus on adding animation, more celebration sound effects, and multiple levels of increasing difficulty. Animations could make the horse’s movement and the falling apples feel more dynamic and engaging, while sound effects could provide feedback when apples are missed. Adding levels would allow the speed, number of apples, or obstacles to gradually increase, keeping players interested and challenged over time. I was orginally planning on adding a second level if the user missed less then 5 where the weird apples were downpouring from the top of the screen .These improvements would make the overall experience more immersive and polished, turning the simple prototype into a more complete and enjoyable game.
